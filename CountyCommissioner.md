### County Budget
The Commissioners Court is responsible for adopting the County budget and setting the tax rate.The County's fiscal year is Oct. 1st to Sept. 30th of each year. Each summer the Commissioners set the budget for the coming fiscal year. The County Budget Officer prepares a recommended budget for the court. A series of workshops are held in July for the County elected officials and department heads to review their recommended budget with the court. In addition, the court is required to hold a public hearing if the proposed tax rate will be increased more than 3%. The final budget is usually adopted by the end of August each year. The Commissioners Court also sets the tax rate at this time.
