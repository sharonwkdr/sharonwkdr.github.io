If you live in Williamson County, Texas, I am your neighbor who is running for County Commissioner!  

I have a full life with family, friends, and community, but I have chosen to work for your vote at this time due to the opportunity and need of Williamson County.  We all need to work together!

* Now is the time to place the education of our children first and foremost
* Now is the time to work on our infrastructure to make our county more robust and sustainable
* Now is the time to push for renewable energy and composting in order to help our planet

Please join me in electing people to office that are focused on helping our county now and into the future!

_with love_,

**Sharon Cummings**
