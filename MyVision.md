# Vision
THe following are some of my core beliefs and the goals for which I focus my efforts.

### Improving our Evironment

* In every project that I work on, I do and will look for the long term and sustainable improvement of our air and water and climate,

* Understanding that renewable Energy is the only path to a healthy planet, I will always push for sources that are carbon neutral and maximize the power of Mother Nature in order to fulfill the County's energy needs.  That includes Solar and Wind Power.

* Today, any one of us could plan a car trip to anywhere in the USA, knowing that we could stop at regular intervals and put more gas in our cars in order to reach our destination.  That is because there is an infrastructure in place to support our Internal Combustion Engines.  It is my vision that in any way possible, I use my position in life to encourage the development of a similar network of power stations for the all-electric vehicle.  Once our citizens begin to see that it is as easy to supply power to the all-electric vehicles as it is to fill the gas-powered vehicles, they will be much more apt to purchase and drive the new technology, thereby reducing the horrible greenhouse gasses that are not destroying our quality of life.

* Instead of building more and more roads for single car transportation, my focus will be to develop mass transit options so that commuters can relax or work on projects or visit without having to worry about driving their individual cars to and from work and shoppiing.

### Quality Public Education 

* The Constitution of the United States of America requires that our government provide free education to our children.
*
..* Every child who lives within Williamson County deserves to have a good, comprehensive, education that will prepare that child to cope well with what their future will demand of them,
